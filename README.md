This application was created for a Learn With Me session at [CodeNewbie](http://www.codenewbie.org/). This session is dedicated to learning the basics of building an API for a Ruby on Rails application, and we will be following along with [this blog post](https://codelation.com/blog/rails-restful-api-just-add-water) from [The Codelation Blog](https://codelation.com/blog/) in order to construct a basic API.
